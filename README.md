# Instabot1
I had to do a project in a course in which I have to make an instabot for instagram which can perform various queries...


1. Login into my account.
2. List the handlers whose names start from "food"
3. First follow and then unfollow the SoDelhi handler
4. First like and then dislike the first 30 posts of "dilseefoodie" handler.
5. Find the names of first 500 followers of "Sodelhi" and "foodtalkindia" handlers.
6. Print those handlers who follow foodtalk india..and I follow then but they don't follow me back.
7.Check if "Codingninjas" handler have updated a story or not..if updated then print whether you have seen the story till now or not.
